# CLI Master

CLI Master is a gamified terminal learning platform that teaches Linux command-line skills through interactive lessons, challenges, and a reward system. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, it provides a safe sandbox environment for mastering CLI commands.

## Features

**🏫 Learning System**
- Interactive lessons with step-by-step guidance
- 4 learning units: File Management, Text Processing, Process Management, Practice & Review
- Real-time command execution feedback
- Progress tracking with XP and leveling
- Streak system for daily engagement

**🎮 Gamification**
- Earn XP and Bits (in-game currency)
- Daily challenges with rewards
- Achievement system with milestones
- Spin wheel for random rewards
- Shop to spend Bits on cosmetic upgrades

**🛠️ Tools**
- Terminal emulator with command validation
- Quiz system for knowledge testing
- Review system to reinforce learning
- Settings with data reset option
- Progress persistence via localStorage

**📚 Curriculum**
- 14+ lessons covering essential Linux commands
- Units organized by topic for structured learning
- Hands-on challenges with simulated file system
- Gradual difficulty progression

## Getting Started

## Development

The project is configured for:
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint for code quality
- Hot module replacement
- Production-ready builds

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Modal-based Navigation**: Instead of page routing, the app uses modal overlays for different features (Shop, Settings, SpinWheel) to maintain state and avoid React Router hook conflicts.

2. **Simulated File System**: A virtual file system provides safe command practice without accessing the user's actual files.

3. **Unit-Based Learning**: Lessons are grouped into logical units for better learning progression.

4. **Gamification Layer**: XP, Bits, achievements, and daily challenges encourage consistent learning habits.
